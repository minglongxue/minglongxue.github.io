I am currently a Lecturer in the College of Computer Science and Engineering at Chongqing University of Technology. I have been honoured as Shiji Scholar of Chongqing University of Technology. Before coming to Chongqing University of Technology, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Nanjing University in 2021. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from Chongqing Jiaotong University and Yunnan Minzu University in 2013 and 2017 respectively.
